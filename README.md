This is a Documentation website, or atleast a template for it. This is a back-up coming up torwards the end, and for you, you can  learn a lot about how CSS works if you haven't already.

The assets can be found: [here](https://codepen.io/Kass09/pen/NBpdrP).

## FAQ

**Now, my fav, FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this to fit my needs?

Yeah! That is why we make these repositories for. For you! To tinker and try new things!

#### Can I host this? If I can how?

You can! with my favourite Apache Container, XAMPP! Since I have explained atleast 15 times. We can skip it.

Here is a [download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to the server, XAMPP. And if you are struggling about, you can start hosting with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) (by MainlyWebStuff).

And if you trust your web skills, you can use this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (by Soeng Souy) to self-host a domain.

## Documentation

- I have been hinting at a Documentation website for a while, but the thing is I can't give you the best advice in this modern world, of a ChatBot everywhere. You could get a better answer.

- So here is the only person who could show you about the tutorial and actually show you the best:

- [Technical Documentation Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-dJPCxwXQs) by Landon Schlagen.

## API Reference

There are no APIs, in this project, and only made in HTML and CSS, only. No Frameworks, only Fonts, and that is it. If there is any I will update the readMe.
